# PythonBeginner
This is a project to record the codes I used in learning Python
I will try to put more codes with actual business function in here.

Please feel free to let me know if you have any idea or advice.

naming rules -
nnn_name - program that can be used for some business functions
Lnn_name - codes that I used to record my learning progress.

Thanks
